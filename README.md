# Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)
This project contains various scripts used as part of the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) training course as provided by The Linux Academy that relate to my specific setup.

Dig into each of the folders to explore the syllabus covered, and lots of really helpful commands when working with kubernetes clusters.

The curriculum for the CKAD course can be found at: [https://github.com/cncf/curriculum](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum)

This learning course focuses on version 1.14.1 of the course, as at the 17th of June 2019.
